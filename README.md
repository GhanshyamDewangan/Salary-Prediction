# Employee Salary Prediction AI

A **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts whether an employee's income is likely to exceed $50K annually, based on demographic and occupational attributes. The application supports real-time predictions, batch predictions via CSV uploads, and optional voice input for interactive use.

---

##  Introduction

This AI-powered tool leverages a trained `RandomForestClassifier` on the **UCI Adult Dataset** to classify whether an individual's salary is **> $50K** or **≤ $50K**. It provides both manual and voice-assisted input options, making it accessible and interactive. The application also supports batch processing for evaluating multiple records via CSV files.

---

##  Features

- **Single Employee Salary Prediction**  
  Manually enter details or use voice input to predict whether the salary exceeds $50K.

- **Batch Prediction from CSV**  
  Upload a CSV file containing multiple employee records and view predictions in a table.

- **Speech Recognition (Optional)**  
  Users can fill in fields like age, education, occupation, and working hours using their voice.

- **Machine Learning Model**  
  Uses a trained `RandomForestClassifier` on a preprocessed version of the UCI Adult dataset.

- **Model Accuracy Display**  
  Real-time display of model training accuracy for user confidence.

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
- **SpeechRecognition** (Google Speech API)

##  Dataset

This application uses the **UCI Adult Dataset**, a public dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that includes demographic data used to predict income level.

### Key features used:

- `age`
- `education`
- `occupation`
- `hours-per-week`

All data is cleaned: missing values are removed, and categorical features are encoded.

source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

##  Usage

Once the app launches in your browser:

- Choose between **Single Prediction** or **Batch Prediction**.
- Enter employee details manually or opt for **Voice Input**.
- For batch predictions, upload a correctly formatted CSV file.
- View model accuracy and prediction results in real time.

---

##  Voice Input Instructions

To use voice input:

1. Ensure microphone access is enabled in your browser.
2. Check the **"Use Voice Input"** box in the app.
3. Speak clearly when prompted for:

   - **Age** (e.g., "thirty-five")
   - **Education** (e.g., "Bachelors")
   - **Occupation** (e.g., "Sales")
   - **Hours-per-week** (e.g., "forty")

If speech input fails, manual entry will still be available.

##  Input Requirements for CSV Upload

Your CSV file must contain the following column headers (case-sensitive):

```csv
age,education,occupation,hours-per-week
```

Each row should represent one employee record.

##  Troubleshooting

- **Speech Recognition Not Working?**
  - Ensure your browser has microphone access.
  - Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility.
  - Fallback to manual entry if speech input fails.

- **Streamlit App Not Launching?**
  - Check your Python version (must be 3.8+).
  - Reinstall packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **CSV Upload Fails?**
  - Ensure the file includes the correct column headers and data types.
